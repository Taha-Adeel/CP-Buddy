          Problem Statement: For an array b of size m, we define: the maximum prefix position of b is the smallest index i that satisfies b1+…+bi=maxm j=1(b1+…+bj); the maximum suffix position of b is the largest index i that satisfies bi+…+bm=maxm j=1(bj+…+bm). You are given three integers n, x, and y (x>y). Construct an array a of size n satisfying: ai is either 1 or -1 for all 1≤i≤n; the maximum prefix position of a is x; the maximum suffix position of a is y. If there are multiple arrays that meet the conditions, print any. It can be proven that such an array always exists under the given conditions. \
          Editorial: First, we consider making presumx>presumj for all x<i≤n , and similarly for y . We can think of a trivial construction: a[r,…,l]=[1,…,1],a[1,…...,r-1]=[-1,…,-1] and a[l+1,…,n]=[-1,…,-1] . The construction doesn't works when presumx<0 , but we are close to the correct solution. Next, we will make a little adjustment: a[r,…,l]=[1,…,1],a[1,…...,r-1]=[…,1,-1] and a[l+1,…,n]=[-1,1,…] . It is not hard to see presumx≥presumj for all x<i≤n , and for 1≤i≤y , max(presumi)-min(presumi)≤1 . Thus, we get presumx≥2+presumy-1≥2+min(presumi)≥1+max(presumi) . The same applies to the suffix sum as well. Therefore, this construction is valid. Time complexity:  O(n) "},],
